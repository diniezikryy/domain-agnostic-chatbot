According to the policy documents, \"Major Cancer\" includes conditions such as leukemia, lymphoma, and sarcoma. However, it is important to note that not all tumors are classified as Major Cancer for the purposes of this coverage.\n\nThe policy explicitly states that \"Major Cancer diagnosed on the basis of finding tumour cells and/or tumour-associated molecules in blood, saliva, faeces, urine or any other bodily fluid in the absence of further definitive and clinically verifiable evidence does not meet the above definition.\" Additionally, tumors that are classified as pre-malignant, non-invasive, carcinoma-in-situ, or have borderline malignancy are excluded from the definition of Major Cancer.\n\nTo summarize, Major Cancer is defined as specific types of cancer that meet the criteria outlined in the policy, and certain conditions and classifications are explicitly excluded.

However, it also outlines several exclusions that are important to consider. For instance, all tumors classified as pre-malignant, non-invasive, or carcinoma-in-situ (CIS) are excluded from coverage. This means that if a cancer is diagnosed at an early stage and classified as CIS, it would not be covered unless it is the first occurrence of CIS, and even then, certain types like carcinoma-in-situ of the skin (both melanoma and non-melanoma) are explicitly excluded.\n\nTo clarify, the policy states: \"For the above definition, the following are excluded: All tumours which are histologically classified as any of the following: Pre-malignant; Non-invasive; Carcinoma-in-situ (Tis) or Ta; Having borderline malignancy; Having any degree of malignant potential; Having suspicious malignancy; Neoplasm of uncertain or unknown behaviour.\"\n\nSo, while major cancers like leukemia and lymphoma are covered, many early-stage cancers and specific classifications are not.

If you miss this deadline, we won't automatically reject your claim, but you'll need to provide a valid reason for the delay. The policy states, \"If we are not told of the claim or have not received all relevant documents within thirty days, we will not reject the claim if you have a valid reason for the delay.\"\n\n2. **For claims related to accidental death or total and permanent disability (TPD)**: The same 30-day notification rule applies.
