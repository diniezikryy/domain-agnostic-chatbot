According to the policy documents, major cancer is defined as a condition involving \"invasion and destruction of normal tissue.\" This includes, but is not limited to, types of cancer such as leukemia, lymphoma, and sarcoma.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that certain conditions are explicitly excluded from this definition. For instance, tumors that are classified as pre-malignant, non-invasive, carcinoma in situ, or have borderline malignancy do not qualify as major cancer under this policy. Additionally, findings based solely on tumor cells or tumor-associated molecules in bodily fluids without further definitive evidence do not meet the criteria for claiming major cancer.\n\nTo summarize, major cancer is recognized when there is a definitive diagnosis involving the invasion of normal tissue, and it does not include less severe or ambiguous conditions.

For instance:\n\n1. **Excluded Tumors**: The policy excludes all tumors that are histologically classified as pre-malignant, non-invasive, carcinoma-in-situ (Tis or Ta), or having borderline malignancy, among others. This means that many early-stage or less aggressive cancers are not covered.\n\n2. **Specific Exclusions**: Certain cancers like prostate cancers classified as T1N0M0 or below, all thyroid cancers at the same classification, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia less than RAI Stage 3 are also excluded from coverage.\n\n3. **Skin Cancers**: Non-melanoma skin carcinomas and certain other skin-related malignancies are excluded unless there is evidence of metastasis.\n\nIn summary, while major cancers like leukemia, lymphoma, and sarcoma are covered, many common cancers and early-stage tumors fall outside the coverage due to the specific exclusions outlined in the policy.

This means that you must have been covered under the policy for a certain period before you can make a claim for a critical illness.\n\n3. **Documentation**: Gather all relevant documents to support your claim. This includes proof of diagnosis and any medical records that demonstrate the critical illness.\n\n4. **Claim Notification**: Notify the insurance company about the claim as soon as possible. While the policy does not specify a strict timeline for critical illness claims like it does for death claims (which must be reported within six months), it\u2019s best to act promptly.\n\n5. **Exclusions**: Keep in mind the exclusions that apply. Claims for critical illnesses caused by self-inflicted injuries, misuse of drugs or alcohol, pre-existing conditions, or certain specified conditions within 90 days of coverage commencement will not be payable.\n\n6. **Survival Clause**: Lastly, remember that the insured must survive for a period of 30 days from the date of diagnosis for the claim to be valid.\n\nIf you follow these steps and ensure that you meet all the criteria outlined in the policy, you should be able to successfully submit a claim for critical illness. If you have any further questions or need assistance with specific documentation, feel free to ask!",
          "prudential": "To make a critical illness claim under the PRUActive Protect policy, you will need to follow a few specific steps. Here\u2019s a clear breakdown of the process:\n\n1. **Diagnosis Requirement**: First, ensure that the life assured has been diagnosed with one of the listed critical illnesses as defined in the policy. The policy states that \"the life assured is required to survive for at least 7 days from the date of diagnosis before the relevant benefit is payable.\"\n\n2. **Gather Documentation**: Collect all necessary documentation, including medical reports and diagnosis confirmation from a qualified healthcare provider. This will be essential for substantiating your claim.\n\n3. **Submit Your Claim**: You will need to submit your claim to the insurance provider. This typically involves filling out a claim form and providing the gathered documentation. Make sure to check if there are any specific forms required for critical illness claims.\n\n4. **Wait for Processing**: After submission, the insurance company will review the claim. They will verify the diagnosis and ensure that it meets the policy criteria. \n\n5. **Claim Approval and Payment**: If the claim is approved, the policy states that the PRUmultiple crisis cover will pay out the sum assured in one lump sum. Additionally, upon the first critical illness claim, \"all future premiums will be waived,\" allowing you to focus on recovery without the burden of ongoing payments.\n\n6. **Future Claims**: If you need to make additional claims for different categories of critical illness, remember that there are waiting periods. For instance, claims for illnesses from the same category require a 24-month waiting period, while claims from different categories require a 12-month waiting period.\n\nIn summary, yes, you can make a critical illness claim by following these steps, ensuring you meet the diagnosis and documentation requirements, and understanding the waiting periods for future claims.

This means that if you had any health issues or symptoms before your policy started, those would not be covered.\n\nSpecifically, the policy states: \"Any Critical Illness which was Diagnosed prior to the effective date of coverage of the respective Insured Person\" is excluded from coverage. Additionally, if it can be established that the insured sought advice or treatment for symptoms indicative of a critical illness before the coverage began, that illness would also not be covered.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s worth noting that certain conditions, like age-related illnesses, may be covered if they manifest after the effective date or fall under specific coverage provisions.

Specifically, the policy states: \n\n> \"Pre-existing Critical Illness means a Critical Illness for which prior to the commencement of this insurance... symptoms of the Critical Illness existed that would cause an ordinarily prudent person to seek diagnosis, care or treatment...\"\n\nFurthermore, the policy explicitly states in the exceptions section:\n\n> \"The Company will not pay any benefits: (a) if there was a Pre-existing Critical Illness which is the same Critical Illness which is the subject of a claim under this Rider...\"\n\nThis means that if a critical illness was pre-existing, it will not be covered by the policy if you later file a claim for that same illness. \n\nSo, in summary, pre-existing conditions are not covered under this policy, which is a common stipulation in many insurance policies to manage risk.

This suggests that if a condition existed before the policy was taken out, it may not be covered immediately. \n\nHowever, the policy does provide coverage for a broad range of medical conditions, including complications from diabetes, which could potentially include conditions that may have been pre-existing if they fall under the listed categories. \n\nIt's important to note that once a claim is made for a listed medical condition, the list of covered conditions may be reduced, and you cannot make a claim for the same condition again. \n\nIn summary, while some pre-existing conditions may be covered after the waiting period, it largely depends on the specific condition and whether it falls within the policy's coverage terms. I recommend reviewing the product summary closely and discussing any specific concerns with a Prudential Financial Consultant for clarity tailored to individual circumstances."

The policy also distinguishes between different stages of cancer, such as early-stage conditions like carcinoma in situ and various early cancers, which are covered under different payout severity levels.\n\nFor instance, the policy mentions that claims can be made for \"up to two instances of cancer\" as long as there is a 5-year cancer-free period between diagnoses. This indicates that major cancer is likely considered to be a more advanced diagnosis compared to early-stage cancers.\n\nIf you need more specific details or examples of what constitutes \"major cancer,\" I would recommend checking the Product Summary or contacting Prudential directly for the most accurate and comprehensive information."

If we don\u2019t receive this information within that timeframe, we will not pay the claim. The policy states, \"If we are not told of the claim or have not received all relevant documents for any of your above claim within two years from the date of the event giving rise to the claim, we will not pay the claim.\"\n\n2. **For specific claims like accidental death or total and permanent disability (TPD)**: You must notify us and provide all relevant documents within **thirty days** after the incident.
