According to the policy documents, Major Cancer includes conditions such as leukemia, lymphoma, and sarcoma. However, it is important to note that certain tumors are excluded from this definition. Specifically, tumors that are classified as pre-malignant, non-invasive, carcinoma-in-situ, or having borderline malignancy do not qualify as Major Cancer for the purposes of a claim.\n\nTo clarify, the policy states: \"The term Major Cancer includes, but is not limited to, leukemia, lymphoma and sarcoma.\" However, it also specifies that \"All tumours which are histologically classified as any of the following: Pre-malignant; Non-invasive; Carcinoma-in-situ (Tis) or Ta; Having borderline malignancy; Having any degree of malignant potential; Having suspicious malignancy; Neoplasm of uncertain or unknown behaviour; or All grades of dysplasia, squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL and LSIL) and intraepithelial neoplasia\" are excluded.\n\nAdditionally, it\u2019s worth noting that a Major Cancer diagnosis does not need to be in remission to claim for re-diagnosis, which can be beneficial for policyholders who experience a recurrence.\n\nIn summary, if a diagnosis falls under the specified types of cancer and does not meet the exclusion criteria, it would be considered Major Cancer for coverage purposes.

This diagnosis needs to be supported by clinical, radiological, histological, and laboratory evidence that is acceptable to the company.\n\n3. **Gather Medical Evidence**: You will need to provide all necessary medical reports and evidence required for the claim. It's important to note that the cost of these reports will be at the policyholder's expense.\n\n4. **Possible Medical Examination**: If the company requires it, the life assured may need to undergo a medical examination by a practitioner appointed by the company.\n\n5. **Claim Admission**: Once your claim is admitted, the policy will pay out the sum assured in one lump sum and waive all future premiums, allowing you to focus on recovery.\n\nMake sure to keep all documentation organized and submit your claim as soon as possible to avoid any delays.

For example, if your sum assured is $50,000, you could receive up to that amount for a critical illness claim.\n\n2. **Multiple Claims**: The policy allows for multiple claims, with a maximum benefit payable of up to 500% of the sum assured. This means if you have a sum assured of $50,000, you could potentially claim up to $250,000 over time, provided you meet the conditions for each claim.\n\n3. **Specific Illnesses**: For certain conditions, like angioplasty or other invasive treatments for coronary artery issues, the payout is 10% of the sum assured, capped at $25,000. For carcinoma in situ of specified organs, the payout is also 10% of the sum assured, but can go up to $150,000 depending on the severity and treatment.\n\n4. **Waiting Period**: It's important to note that the life assured must survive at least 7 days from the date of diagnosis for the benefit to be payable.\n\nIn summary, the payout for critical illness can be substantial, depending on your chosen coverage and the specific illness diagnosed.
