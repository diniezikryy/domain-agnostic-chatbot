      "response": "To identify the exclusions present in SingLife's critical illness policy that are not in FWD's critical illness policy, we can analyze the provided documents.\n\n### Exclusions in SingLife's Critical Illness Policy\nThe documents related to SingLife do not explicitly list exclusions. However, they do mention coverage for pre-existing conditions such as Type 2 Diabetes, high blood pressure, and other related conditions, indicating a more inclusive approach to coverage [Source 1, Source 12]. \n\n### Exclusions in FWD's Critical Illness Policy\nFWD's policy documents provide specific exclusions, including:\n1. **Pre-existing Conditions**: FWD will not pay any benefits if the signs or symptoms leading to diagnosis and claim became apparent before the policy issue date or reinstatement date [Source 13].\n2. **Suicide or Self-inflicted Acts**: Claims arising from suicide, attempted suicide, or intentional self-inflicted acts are excluded [Source 15].\n3. **General Exclusions**: There are general exclusions that may apply, but specific details are not fully outlined in the provided documents [Source 5, Source 7].\n\n### Comparison of Exclusions\n1. **Pre-existing Conditions**: SingLife explicitly covers certain pre-existing conditions, while FWD excludes benefits for conditions that were apparent before the policy's issue or reinstatement date [Source 1, Source 12; Source 13].\n2. **Suicide or Self-inflicted Acts**: This exclusion is present in FWD's policy but is not mentioned in SingLife's documents, suggesting that SingLife may not have this exclusion or it is not explicitly stated [Source 15; no mention in Sources 1-4].\n3. **General Exclusions**: FWD mentions general exclusions but does not specify them in detail, while SingLife does not provide any exclusions in the documents reviewed [Source 5, Source 7; Sources 1-4].\n\n### Conclusion\nIn summary, the key exclusion present in FWD's critical illness policy that is not mentioned in SingLife's policy is the exclusion related to pre-existing conditions that were apparent before the policy's issue date. Additionally, FWD has a specific exclusion for suicide and self-inflicted acts, which is not addressed in the SingLife documents. The SingLife policy appears to be more inclusive regarding pre-existing conditions, while FWD has stricter exclusions in this regard. \n\nThe documents do not provide a comprehensive list of exclusions for SingLife, making it difficult to draw a complete comparison. Therefore, it is advisable to consult the full policy documents for both insurers for a detailed understanding of exclusions.",

      "response": "To compare the price differences between SingLife Essential Critical Illness II and FWD Critical Illness Plus, we will examine the specific pricing examples provided in the policy documents.\n\n### SingLife Essential Critical Illness II\n1. **Pricing Example**: \n   - A 25-year-old female (Vanessa) purchases a policy with a coverage amount of S$150,000 and a policy term of 45 years.\n   - Monthly premium: S$31.55\n   - Total premiums paid over the policy term: S$17,037\n   - No Claim Reward: S$3,407 at the end of the policy term if no claims are made [Source 2].\n\n2. **Additional Information**:\n   - The policy is designed to cover a comprehensive range of critical illnesses and offers benefits for individuals with pre-existing conditions [Source 1, 4].\n\n### FWD Critical Illness Plus\n1. **Pricing Information**: \n   - The documents do not provide specific pricing examples for FWD Critical Illness Plus based on a particular customer profile. They mention that premiums are regular and non-participating, but do not specify amounts or examples for any age or coverage amount [Sources 6, 12].\n\n### Summary of Findings\n- **Price Comparison**: \n   - For SingLife Essential Critical Illness II, the specific monthly premium for a 25-year-old female is S$31.55 for S$150,000 coverage. In contrast, FWD Critical Illness Plus does not provide any specific premium amounts or examples in the documents reviewed, making a direct price comparison impossible.\n   - Therefore, we cannot directly compare prices due to the lack of specific premium information for FWD Critical Illness Plus [Sources 2, 6].\n\n### Conclusion\n- **SingLife Essential Critical Illness II** has a clearly defined premium structure with an example provided, while **FWD Critical Illness Plus** lacks specific pricing details in the documents reviewed.

However, FWD lacks coverage for pre-existing conditions, which may limit its appeal to some applicants.

      "query": "What does the critical illness policy from FWD cover that SingLife's one does not?",
      "response": "The critical illness policies from FWD and SingLife have distinct features and benefits. Below is a comprehensive comparison highlighting what FWD covers that SingLife does not, based on the provided documents.\n\n### Unique Coverage and Benefits of FWD Critical Illness Plus\n\n1. **ICU Benefit Add-On Rider**: FWD offers an ICU Benefit add-on rider, which provides additional coverage for hospitalization in an Intensive Care Unit (ICU) due to a covered critical illness [Source 14]. This specific benefit is not mentioned in the SingLife policy documents.\n\n2. **Loss of Independent Existence**: FWD includes a definition for \"Loss of Independent Existence,\" which is a condition resulting in the inability to perform at least three of the six activities of daily living for a continuous period of six months [Source 8]. This specific benefit is not referenced in the SingLife policy.\n\n3. **Carcinoma in-situ Coverage**: FWD explicitly covers carcinoma in-situ, defined as a focal autonomous new growth of carcinomatous cells confined to the cells in which it originated [Source 6]. The SingLife policy does not mention this specific condition.\n\n4. **Major Burns Coverage**: FWD includes coverage for major burns, specifically third-degree burns covering at least 20% of the body surface [Source 9]. This condition is not listed in the SingLife policy documents.\n\n5. **No Waiting Period for Certain Conditions**: FWD specifies that there is no waiting period for certain critical illnesses, which may include conditions not covered in the same way by SingLife [Source 5]. The SingLife documents do not mention any similar provisions.\n\n### Summary of Coverage from SingLife\n\n- **Comprehensive Range of Critical Illnesses**: SingLife's policy covers a broad range of critical illnesses, including those related to existing conditions like Type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure [Source 1].\n- **No Claim Reward**: SingLife offers a No Claim Reward, which provides a payout at the end of the policy term if no claims are made [Source 3]. This feature is not mentioned in FWD's documents.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn summary, FWD's Critical Illness Plus policy includes unique benefits such as the ICU Benefit add-on rider, specific coverage for carcinoma in-situ and major burns, and provisions for loss of independent existence. These features are not present in SingLife's Essential Critical Illness II policy, which focuses on a broader range of critical illnesses and offers a No Claim Reward. \n\nThe documents do not provide information about any other specific benefits or riders that may be exclusive to SingLife that are not covered by FWD [Sources 1-15].",
