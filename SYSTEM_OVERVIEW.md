## High-Level Architecture

The system consists of three major components working together:

**Document Processing** → Converts raw files into searchable indexes
**Batch Management** → Organizes and switches between document domains  
**Query Processing** → Handles user questions with intelligent retrieval and response generation

## Component Breakdown

### 1. Main CLI Interface (main.py)

Entry point for user interactions. Handles command-line arguments and routes requests to appropriate components.

Key responsibilities:
- Parse user commands and arguments
- Initialize BatchManager and QueryProcessor
- Handle batch operations (list, info, switch, set-default)
- Display query responses to user

### 2. Batch Manager (batch_manager.py)

Manages different document domains and provides switching capability.

Key responsibilities:
- Load and save batch registry (batch_registry.json)
- Switch between document batches
- Track batch metadata (document count, creation date, file paths)
- Provide FAISS and BM25 index paths to QueryProcessor

Registry structure:
- Stores batch ID, name, description, document count
- Maps batch ID to FAISS and BM25 index locations
- Tracks default batch for queries

### 3. Document Processor (document_processor.py)

Converts raw documents into searchable indexes.

Processing pipeline:
1. Read documents using FileHandler (PDF, DOCX, TXT, MD)
2. Extract and clean text
3. Split into 800-character chunks with 100-character overlap
4. Generate embeddings via OpenAI API (text-embedding-3-small)
5. Build FAISS index for semantic search
6. Build BM25 index for keyword search
7. Save indexes and metadata to batch directory

### 4. Query Processor (query_processor.py) - ENHANCED

Handles user questions with advanced RAG techniques.

Processing pipeline:
1. **Query Analysis** - Detect comparison vs single-topic queries, identify mentioned sources
2. **Query Decomposition** - Break complex questions into 4-10 focused sub-questions using GPT-4o-mini
3. **Balanced Search** - Retrieve equal chunks from each source (10:10 for comparisons)
4. **Evidence Verification** - Check if sufficient data exists before answering
5. **Zero-Trust Generation** - Generate response with strict citation requirements using GPT-4o-mini
6. **Performance Tracking** - Log processing time and retrieval statistics

Key innovations:
- Intelligent query decomposition for comprehensive coverage
- Balanced retrieval prevents bias toward any single source
- Evidence verification prevents hallucinations
- Zero-trust prompts ensure all claims are cited

### 5. Search Engine (utils/search.py)

Implements hybrid FAISS + BM25 search.

Components:
- **SearchIndexBuilder** - Creates indexes during batch setup
- **HybridSearchEngine** - Performs real-time search queries

Search process:
1. FAISS semantic search using vector embeddings
2. BM25 keyword search using term frequency
3. Normalize and combine scores (60% FAISS + 40% BM25)
4. Balance results by source if needed
5. Return top K deduplicated chunks

### 6. File Handlers (utils/file_handlers.py)

Extracts text from different document formats.

Supported formats:
- PDF (PyPDF2 with page tracking)
- DOCX (python-docx)
- TXT (UTF-8 encoding)
- MD (Markdown)

Features:
- Smart chunking at sentence boundaries
- Page number tracking for citations
- Year extraction from filenames
- Metadata preservation

### 7. Embedding Generator (utils/embeddings.py)

Generates vector embeddings for semantic search.

Specifications:
- Model: OpenAI text-embedding-3-small
- Dimensions: 1536
- Batch processing: 100 texts per API call
- Handles rate limiting gracefully

### 8. Evaluation Suite (tests/test_queries.py) - NEW

Automated quality assurance testing.

Test categories:
- Comparison queries
- Coverage queries
- Recommendation queries
- Single policy queries
- Limitation handling

Quality checks:
- Required terms present
- Both policies cited in comparisons
- Limitations acknowledged
- Source citations present
- No prohibited claims
- Different customer profiles noted

Current performance:
- Test pass rate: 100% (8/8)
- Overall score: 95.7% (45/47)

## End-to-End Flow

### Phase 1: Document Setup (One-time per domain)

User adds documents to documents/insurance/ and runs:
```bash
python setup_batch.py insurance
```

Processing steps:
1. FileHandler extracts text from PDFs page by page
2. Text is split into 800-character chunks with 100-character overlap
3. OpenAI API generates 1536-dimensional embeddings
4. FAISS index created for semantic similarity search
5. BM25 index created for keyword matching
6. Metadata saved with batch info
7. Batch registered in batch_registry.json

Result: Searchable indexes ready for querying

### Phase 2: Query Processing (Real-time)

User runs:
```bash
python main.py --batch insurance "What are the pros and cons of SingLife vs FWD?"
```

Processing steps:

**Step 1: Query Analysis**
- Detect comparison query (contains "vs", "pros and cons")
- Identify mentioned policies: SingLife, FWD

**Step 2: Query Decomposition**
- GPT-4o-mini breaks query into 10 focused sub-questions
- Balanced: 5 questions for SingLife, 5 for FWD
- Each targets specific aspect (benefits, riders, limitations, etc.)

**Step 3: Hybrid Search**
- For each sub-question:
  - FAISS search: Generate query vector, find similar chunks
  - BM25 search: Tokenize query, calculate TF-IDF scores
  - Combine: 60% FAISS + 40% BM25
  - Return top 5 chunks

**Step 4: Balanced Retrieval**
- Collect all chunks from 10 sub-queries (~50 total)
- Categorize by source: SingLife chunks vs FWD chunks
- Balance: Take top 10 from each source by combined score
- Final result: 20 chunks (10 SingLife + 10 FWD)

**Step 5: Evidence Verification**
- Check all mentioned policies present in results
- Verify minimum chunk count retrieved
- If insufficient: Return "Cannot answer, only found X, missing Y"
- If sufficient: Proceed to generation

**Step 6: Context Building**
- Format 20 chunks with metadata
- Each chunk labeled: [Source X: filename, Page Y, Year Z]
- Provide to GPT-4o-mini as context

**Step 7: Zero-Trust Response Generation**
- GPT-4o-mini receives strict instructions:
  - Only state facts from documents
  - Cite every claim with [Source X]
  - If no info: "Documents don't provide..."
  - Be comprehensive: List ALL features mentioned
  - Distinguish "not mentioned" vs "explicitly excluded"
  - For pros/cons: At least 4-6 items per side
- Temperature: 0.1 (factual)
- Max tokens: 1500 (comprehensive)

**Step 8: Response Display**
- Formatted answer with citations
- Processing time logged
- Retrieval balance shown

## Advanced Features

### Query Decomposition

Complex queries are automatically broken into focused sub-questions.

Example:
```
Input: "What are the pros and cons of SingLife vs FWD?"

Decomposed into:
1. What are ALL unique benefits of SingLife?
2. What are ALL unique benefits of FWD?
3. What are ALL riders available in SingLife?
4. What are ALL riders available in FWD?
5. What are limitations of SingLife?
6. What are limitations of FWD?
7. What special benefits does SingLife offer?
8. What special benefits does FWD offer?
9. What makes SingLife application unique?
10. What makes FWD claim process unique?
```

Benefits:
- Comprehensive coverage of all aspects
- Balanced questions for fair comparisons
- Better retrieval precision

### Balanced Retrieval

Ensures fair representation from all sources in comparisons.

Process:
1. Collect chunks from all sub-queries
2. Categorize by source using filename/content matching
3. Take equal amounts from each source (10 per source)
4. Sort by relevance score within each source

Result:
```
=== Retrieval Balance ===
SINGLIFE: 10 chunks
FWD: 10 chunks
========================
```

Prevents bias toward any single source.

### Evidence Verification

Checks data availability before answering.

Verification steps:
1. Check if any results found
2. For comparisons: Verify all mentioned sources present
3. If missing: Return helpful error message
4. If present: Proceed to generation

Example outputs:
- "I cannot confidently answer this question. I can only find information about SingLife. Cannot make fair comparison without FWD data."
- Evidence sufficient → Generate comprehensive answer

### Zero-Trust Response Generation

Strict rules prevent hallucinations.

Requirements:
- Every factual claim must have [Source X] citation
- Distinguish "Policy A mentions X but Policy B doesn't discuss X" vs "Policy B excludes X"
- Never assume silence means exclusion
- Acknowledge missing information explicitly
- Only compare identical customer profiles
- Never claim one option is "better" without specific evidence

Example good response:
```
SingLife explicitly covers pre-existing conditions like Type 2 diabetes [Source 1, Page 3].
FWD's documents don't discuss pre-existing condition acceptance [no mention in Sources 7-12].
```

Example bad response (prevented):
```
SingLife covers pre-existing conditions but FWD doesn't.
```

## Key Algorithms

### 1. Hybrid Search Scoring

```python
# Normalize scores to 0-1 range
faiss_normalized = faiss_score / max_faiss_score
bm25_normalized = bm25_score / max_bm25_score

# Weighted combination
final_score = (faiss_normalized * 0.6) + (bm25_normalized * 0.4)

# Sort by final_score, return top K
```

### 2. Text Chunking Strategy

```python
chunk_size = 800 characters
overlap = 100 characters

# Smart chunking at sentence boundaries
if not at_end:
    find_sentence_ending_in_last_100_chars()
    break_at_sentence_if_found()
    
# Move to next chunk with overlap
start = start + chunk_size - overlap
```

### 3. Query Decomposition

```python
# Use GPT-4o-mini to break complex queries
prompt = """
Break this question into 4-10 focused sub-questions.
For comparisons, generate equal questions for each policy.
Output as JSON: {"questions": [...]}

Question: {query}
"""

response = openai.chat(model="gpt-4o-mini", messages=[...])
sub_questions = json.loads(response)["questions"]
```

### 4. Balanced Retrieval

```python
# Categorize chunks by source
policy_results = {"singlife": [], "fwd": []}
for chunk in all_chunks:
    if "singlife" in chunk["filename"].lower():
        policy_results["singlife"].append(chunk)
    elif "fwd" in chunk["filename"].lower():
        policy_results["fwd"].append(chunk)

# Take equal amounts from each
balanced = []
for policy in ["singlife", "fwd"]:
    top_10 = sorted(policy_results[policy], 
                   key=lambda x: x["score"], 
                   reverse=True)[:10]
    balanced.extend(top_10)

return balanced  # 20 chunks total (10+10)
```

### 5. Evidence Verification

```python
def verify_evidence(query, results, mentioned_policies):
    if not results:
        return False, "No relevant documents found"
    
    # For comparisons, check all policies present
    found_policies = set()
    for result in results:
        for policy in mentioned_policies:
            if policy in result["content"].lower():
                found_policies.add(policy)
    
    missing = set(mentioned_policies) - found_policies
    if missing:
        return False, f"Only found {found_policies}, missing {missing}"
    
    return True, ""
```
